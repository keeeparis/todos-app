<h1> This is simple TO-DO app.</h1>
<h5>All data is stored in localstorage.</h5>

<h3>Add new task</h3>

Simply fill in the form and set priority for the current todo (High-red, Moderate-yellow, Low-green).
Added tasks are ordered by the selected priority to focus on things you decide important.

<h3>Delete tasks</h3>

You can: 
1. Delete each non-finished task.
2. Delete all finished tasks.
5. Delete all tasks.

<h3>Archive</h3>

By deleting finished todos, they are still stored in localstorage. 
This means you can search it by selecting the timeframe when it occured.
If you are no longer interested in archiving todos, it is possible to delete them all. However, this action is irreversible.
